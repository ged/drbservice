# Goal: set up an SSL-enabled DRb service without having to specify the nasty bits yourself.

Feature: A basic DRb service
	In order to create a new basic service
	As a programmer
	I want to be able to just define the service object
		and have the rest of the setup and running of the service taken care of for me

	Scenario: 
	    Given context
	    When event
	    Then outcome
